#### If I am a virtual attendee and I am near the venue can I attend the event?
There are limited physical seats. However, due to the fact that some participants have not arrived, you can come and if there are available seats you are welcome to attend the event in-person.

#### I can't access the livestream.
You should be able to access it through the Whova app (if you have registered adequately). You should be able to access it by selecting Agenda -> Select the session -> Click the livestream. <strong>You must have received an email from the Whova app and have registered for an acccount.</strong>

#### Will the sessions be recorded?
The sessions will not be recorded. <strong>Also, we ask you NOT to record them as some of the participants have not agreed to this.</strong>
