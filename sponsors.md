## Sponsor Policy for the 2024 Mexican NLP Summer School

This sponsor policy is drafted after the [WiNLP Sponsor Policy](https://www.winlp.org/sponsor-policy/), version dated as October 2023.

Sponsors enable our Mexican NLP summer school to provide participants with funds for travel, lodging, registration to the main conference, internet bandwidth, zoom license expenses attendees, caption and translation services, and in some cases support for some of the oganizing volunteers. In 2021, the school was virtual and most of our event costs were associated with online participation, particularly with translation and caption services since our attendees main language was Spanish and our program included international researchers that presented their work in English. For this 2024 edition we anticipate that most of the costs will be allocated to support travel and conference registration to participants.

Our sponsors are classified into two tiers: **major sponsors** and **supporting sponsors**. The expected sponsorship fee associated with each tier is determined as a function of the  type of institution and its size based on reported number of employees.

### Determining Sponsors

The sponsor selection process is carried out at least five months prior to the summer school. If an opportunity arises later to connect with a sponsor not on the selected list, they may be added by consulting the organizing committee. 

### Sponsorship Tiers

We use a tiered structure that factors in the size of for-profit organizations (based on number of employees) to determine the amount of funds for a sponsor to be a major versus a supporting sponsor. We summarize the contribution amounts and benefits below.

|                    | Small (<500 employees)  | Mid (500-5000) | Large (5000+) | Non-profit (any size)     |
|--------------------|-------------------------|----------------|---------------|---------------------------|
| Major Sponsor      | $5,000                  | $10,000        | $20,000       |  >= $5,000                |
| Supporting Sponsor | $2,500                  | $5,000         | $10,000       | $2,500 or in-kind support |

Sponsorship tiers for varying sizes of companies.

#### Major Sponsor:
- Large logo and hyperlink on the website, large logo in pause screen between presentations and sessions
- Up to 3 company representatives at networking and mentorship social event(s)
- Option to address the attendees during the social event
- A list of participants who have opted in to share contact information, for networking or finding professional opportunities
- Acknowledgement at the beginning and end of the summer school
- Option to provide flyers with information showcasing their institution/company and current opportunities, as well as goodies or any other items that are shipped to the local team for on site distribution. 

#### Supporting Sponsor:
- Medium logo and hyperlink on the website
- 1 company representative at networking and mentorship social(s)h
- A list of participants who have opted in to share contact information, for networking/job search purposes
- Acknowledgement at the beginning and end of the summer school

**Note**: the **networking and mentorship socials** will be an opportunity for company representatives/recruiters to mingle with summer school participants and speakers in a casual environment. More details will be communicated at a later date. The type of social events will also depend on the availability of funds.

### Additional sponsor options
#### In-kind sponsorship

Both in the past and moving forward, we are happy to accept other types of donations as forms of material support from our sponsors. Sponsors providing support through these channels who are not otherwise marked in one of the financial tiers above will be listed as “In Kind Sponsors” on our materials and are eligible to receive the following benefits:

- Small logo and hyperlink on the website
- A list of participants who have opted in to share contact information, for networking/job search purposes
- Acknowledgement at the beginning and end of the summer school

Some examples of ways that sponsors have or can support the Mexican NLP Summer School include: 

1. Helping to front costs or book flights directly for a small number of attendees, as they often cannot afford to wait for reimbursement.
2. Offering free software codes for technologies that help with research tasks (e.g., cloud computing or writing).
3. Arranging for (human) live transcription or translation for accessibility.
4. Offering legal visa assistance for authors needing to navigate travel visa requirements.
5. Sponsored sub-events or activities at or associated with a Mexican NLP Summer School-hosted event, such as a sponsored lunch for participants, or a sponsor-led tutorial session.

### Notices of sponsorship limitations

Our events often include invited researchers as speakers, including those who are part of our sponsoring organizations. However, we treat our selection of these speakers as independent of our selection of sponsors. We generally do not solicit lists of suggested speakers from companies and expect that speakers from sponsor companies will primarily direct their talk to their own work and lived experiences instead of recruitment efforts.

While we are happy to share sub-events that are in conjunction with NAACL 2024 with our attendees, we will include a disclaimer on our website and advertisements for such events with the following:

  *"The Mexican NLP Summer School does not endorse the sponsors of our event as employers, nor do we endorse the views they express or the products/services they offer. We are grateful for their sponsorship of our programs and we encourage our participants to do their own research into these organizations."*
