## About The School

In recent years, **Natural Language Processing** has established itself as an interdisciplinary field of study whose objective is to identify the mechanisms that allow computers to process, manipulate, and even understand human language in all its dimensions and modalities: written, spoken,  signed, etc; be it explicitly, as textual language would be, or implicit in the case of communication of feelings or writing styles. We already enjoy several advances from the field today: things such as internet searches, content recommendations, voice recognition, and automatic translation between languages.



The school’s **objective** is to bring participants closer to natural language processing, national research, and to discuss the field’s future at the national and international level. To accomplish this, the school consists of introductory workshops, research talks, and panel discussions. 

Registration opens soon. Stay tuned to our social networks to avoid missing out on this year’s edition. 

## The School’s History

This will be the seventh edition of the Natural Language Processing summer/fall school, and organized by members of [RedTTL de CONACYT](http://redttl.mx/) and [AMPLN](http://ampln.mx/). The first and second editions of the school were at the [Benemérita Universidad Autónoma de Puebla (BUAP)](http://www.buap.mx/) in 2015 and 2016, the [Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana (UAM) unidad Cuajimalpa](http://www.cua.uam.mx/) in 2018, the [Centro de Investigación en Computación](http://www.cic.ipn.mx/) from the [Instituto Politécnico Nacional](http://www.ipn.mx/) in 2019, and held virtually (for the first time) in 2020 by the [Instituto de Investigaciones en Matemáticas Aplicadas y en Sistemas (IIMAS)](https://www.iimas.unam.mx/). Finally, in 2021 the school was organized as a co-located event with NAACL 2021, this was the very 1st time the Mexican NLP summer school was supported by the ACL community, representing a big achievement to all the NLP-Latin American community.
