      <h4>Tutorial title: The Power of Rewards - Reinforcing Language Models with Reinforcement Learning </h4>
	  Language models ranging from BERT to GPT have shown impressive performance on many natural language tasks through first self-supervised pre-training on large text corpora and then fine-tuning on downstream tasks or even with zero-shot or few-shot approaches. These models are also very powerful in solving multiple tasks. However, their capabilities are still limited as they lack a built-in reward signal to directly optimize for the end task objective or align to certain human preferences.On the other hand, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is another area in machine learning which is commonly applied to develop systems that improve over real-time feedback loops (such as games). Because it provides a framework for optimizing goal-directed behavior through rewards. In this tutorial, we will explore how reinforcement learning came into the play of language modeling and suddenly changed the game by reinforcing the representational power of large language models with the ability to more efficiently solve tasks requiring reasoning, planning, and knowledge. We will first provide background on contemporary language models and reinforcement learning fundamentals. Next, we will discuss techniques for applying policy gradient methods to fine-tune language models to maximize rewards from an environment. Attendees will learn how to practically apply RL to language tasks, understand tradeoffs between different algorithms, and gain insight into state-of-the-art research in this emerging field.

      <h4>Tutorial title: Exploring Transformers and Limitations in Language Modeling. </h4>
      This tutorial explores language modeling techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP), covering key concepts from traditional approaches to Transformer architectures. Beginning with an introduction to NLP and language modeling, it delves into probabilistic language models and progresses to neural language models, emphasizing the significance of embeddings for semantic representation. Moving on to Transformer models, we will discuss key concepts such as multi-head attention mechanisms, masked language modeling, and encoder models. Additionally, the tutorial addresses the limitations of large language models, providing insights into challenges and considerations for leveraging these models effectively in practical applications.
