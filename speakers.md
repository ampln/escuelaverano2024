    <h4>Veronica Perez Rosas</h4>
    <p>She obtained her Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of North Texas in 2014. She is a Level I Researcher recognized by the National System of Researchers. Currently, she is a researcher at the University of Michigan, where she is a part of the Artificial Intelligence laboratory and the Inform Language and Information Technologies research group in the Department of Computer Science. Her research interests include natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, computational linguistics, and multimodal representations. Her research focuses on NLP applications, including automatic detection of misinformation, NLP in mental health, as well as the detection of human behaviors such as sentiment, deception, sarcasm, and affective response. More information about her research can be found at https://vrncapr.engin.umich.edu/.</p>

    <h4>Alham Fikri Aji</h4>
    <p>Aji obtained his PhD in computational linguistics from University of Edinburgh, Scotland. He was a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute for Language, Cognition and Computation at the University of Edinburgh where he contributed to efficient NMT-related projects, such as Marian: a fast NMT framework and browser-based translation without using the cloud. Aside from efficient NLP, he is now interested in developing datasets and systems for multilingual NLP especially for under-resourced languages. Aji also co-initiated IndoNLP, a community-based movement to enable and advance NLP research for Indonesian languages. He also worked in several well-known industries such as Apple (language engineer, 2015), Google (intern, 2017), and finally at Amazon (applied scientist, 2021). He also worked at a start-up in Indonesia which is engaged in conversational AI.</p>

    <h4>Jocelyn Dunstan</h4>
    <p>Jocelyn Dunstan holds a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics from the University of Cambridge in the UK, supervised by Ray Goldstein. She began her career in mathematical modeling for healthcare during her postdoctoral fellowship at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Public Health School, working on the Global Obesity Prevention Center. She specializes in leveraging machine learning and natural language processing to address key challenges. Her research primarily revolves around clinical text mining and patient prioritization. In addition to her academic role at the Catholic University of Chile, where she holds a joint appointment between the Department of Computer Science and the Institute for Mathematical Computing, she is actively engaged as a researcher at prominent institutions such as the Center for Mathematical Modeling (CMM), the Millenium Institute for Foundational Research on Data (IMFD), and the Institute for Intelligent Healthcare Engineering (iHealth).
